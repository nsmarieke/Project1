# Project1

## Installation
Besides the anaconda distribution of Python no further installations are needed

## Project motivation
In this project I was interested to find out more about the following things:
- Causes of the French railway train delay
- Which trains has the most delays
- Are the delays getting better

## File description
In this repository there are four notebooks. 
In the project.ipynb notebook the basic data analyses is done. 
In the question_1.ipynb the first question, what is the biggest cause of train delays, is answered.
In the question_2.ipynb the second question, which train has the most delay, is answered.
In the question_3.ipynb the third question, is the delay for the train with the most delay getting better or worse, is answered.

The notebooks are documented with markdowns to assist in understanding the notebook.

## Results
Besides the documentation in the notebook the results can also be found in the following post:
